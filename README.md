# RAY TRACING

## COLLISION

Important: In order for the collision to work properly, the radius of a ball cannot be smaller than the distance between the points of the rays. If that happens, the ball may be rendered between two points of the rays and therefore the collision would be recognized and hence the shadow would be crated.
